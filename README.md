# Incomplete list of computer courses
[中文](README.cn.md)
## 一. Forword
This repository is used to collect excellent computer courses all around the world.

Computer education in many universities generally has problems of obsolete contents and too traditional teaching methods. Based on this fact, I intend to make a catalogue to include the homepages of these courses for you to expand your study.

## 二. Introduce
The courses in the repository will be classified according to the domain of the computer. For each course, it maybe include its home page, MOOC link, forum or other information.

Specific courses under the collection of courses, you can enter the sub directory view.
